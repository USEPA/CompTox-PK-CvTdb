The CvTdb is a database of pharmacokinetic time-series for environmental chemicals. The database is built on a PostgreSQL server.
 
If you have data that you're interested in contributing to the database, please contact Risa Sayre (sayre.risa@epa.gov), Toxicologist at the EPA and project co-owner. We suggest entering "CvT Contribution Request" in the subject line to aid us in responding to your request.
 
Data contributions will need to be formatted using the template "CvT_curation_template.xlsx" in this repo. Please use the Curation SOP ("CvT_Curation_SOP") as a guide for correctly extracting your data to comply with the database's standards.
